# Snake Game
This is a simple browser snake-game. Let's have fun! **[[rep](https://github.com/eugene-serb/snake-game/), [site](https://eugene-serb.github.io/snake-game/)]**

This is a simple browser snake-game in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, BEM and OOP, and no canvas, no libraries or frameworks. Keyboard, gamepad and touchscreen are supported. Contains dark and light themes.

This project contains:
1. ***index.html*** – is the html markup with game-form;
2. ***css/snake.css*** – are the css style's classes used in this game;
3. ***js/snake.js*** – are the scripts that do the magic.
