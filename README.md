# Snake Game
This is a simple browser snake-game. Let's have fun!

This is a simple browser snake-game in JavaScript, HTML and CSS, no canvas, no libraries or frameworks.

This project contains:
1. ***index.html*** – is the html markup with game-form;
2. ***css/snake.css*** – are the css style's classes used in this game;
3. ***js/snake.js*** – are the scripts that do the magic.
